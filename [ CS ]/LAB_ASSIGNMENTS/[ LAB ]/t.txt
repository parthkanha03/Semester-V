>> sudo tcpdump
That's a powerful combination\! You're asking for the `tcpdump` command to:

1.  Specify the **Interface** (`-i`).
2.  Filter by **Protocol** (e.g., `icmp`).
3.  Use the **Verbose** flag (`-v`).
4.  Specifically **Capture ICMP packets**.

Here is the command you are looking for:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i <interface_name> -v icmp
```

### **Command Breakdown:**

| Component | Flag/Keyword | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Elevated Permissions** | `sudo` | Required to capture packets. |
| **Interface Flag** | `-i <interface_name>` | Specifies which network interface to listen on (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`). |
| **Verbose Flag** | `-v` | Increases the level of detail in the output. Use `-vv` or `-vvv` for even more detail\! |
| **Protocol Filter** | `icmp` | Restricts the capture to only Internet Control Message Protocol packets (like ping requests/replies). |

Would you like to know how to filter for other common protocols like **TCP** or **UDP**?
